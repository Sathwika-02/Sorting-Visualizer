## Dependencies
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install tkinter.

```bash
pip install python-tk
```
## What is tkinter
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. 
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

## Algorithms Visualized

* Quick Sort (Time Complexity : N logN)
* Merge Sort (Time Complexity : N logN)
* Insertion Sort (Time Complexity : N ^ 2)
* Selection Sort (Time Complexity : N ^ 2)
* Bubble Sort (Time Complexity : N ^ 2)
